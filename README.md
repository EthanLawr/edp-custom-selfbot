This bot uses [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and [Akairo](https://1computer1.github.io/discord-akairo).  

1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/Evildeathpro/edp-custom-selfbot.git`.
3. Run `npm --only=prod install` to install required dependencies.
4. Run `node edp.js` and enjoy!
5. Update in the future by using `git pull`.

## Configuration
To install dependencies type the following (after using cd to the file path): `npm --only=prod install`
Edit the `config.json` file in `src/data/...`
Rename all `.example` files to not have `.example` in them (within the `src/data/...` files)

Yea, sorry I will not spoonfeed you much. This is just for smart people who probably already have had selfbots but could do with a better one.
